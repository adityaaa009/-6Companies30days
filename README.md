# 6Companies30days Challenge Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the coding problems presented in the #6Companies30days challenge by Arsh Goyal, a Software Engineer at Samsung. This challenge aims to prepare for technical interviews at top 6 tech companies. like Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, and Netflix. 

**Purpose:**

This repository serves as a record of my problem-solving journey and showcases my coding skills. It also serves as a reference for future review and learning.

**Technologies Used:**

* **Programming Languages:** Java
* **Data Structures:** Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables, etc
* **Algorithms:** Sorting (Merge Sort, Quick Sort), Searching (Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search), Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, etc

**Acknowledgments:**

I would like to thank Arsh Goyal for creating this challenging and insightful learning experience.
